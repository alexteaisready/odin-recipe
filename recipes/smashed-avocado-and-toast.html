    <p><h3>Ahh the old smashed avocado on toast. A true canvas for many creations and flavours, potential not too many seem to appreciate. With some feeling 'it doesn't taste of much', to others swearing by the avocado philosophy. It's true nature, typically lies within its mixture with other foods and ingredients. Though in my humble opinion, it's bloody amazing alone with the right amount of salt 'n pepper!</h3></p>
    
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bread (Type chosen can greatly enhance this experience)</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>1 Avocado</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Lemon juice (optional)</li>
    </ul>

     <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
    <ol>
      <li><u><strong>First</strong></u>, we will need to prepare our smashed avocado. Get a kitchen knife and safely remove the seed.</li>
      <li><u><strong>Then</strong></u> we need to get a spoon and scoop out as much as the avocado as you can into a bowl.</li>
      <li><u><strong>After that</strong></u> we need to get a strong metal fork and smash the avocado into as much of a paste as possible (or at least to your preference)</li>
      <li><u><strong>If you want better flavours</strong></u>, adding a little salt and pepper to the mix will make all of the difference, and I <strong>strongly</strong> advise it.
      <li><u><strong>Then</strong></u>, if we want that sweet crunchy texture, we will need to put our bread into a toaster (Ofocourse only if your chosen bread fits) </li>
      <li><u><strong>After that</strong></u> we will butter up our well toasted bread (great choice of bread toastiness by the way), till it is to our preferred butteriness</li>
      <li><u><strong>Lastly</strong></u>, once our bread has been turned into buttered toast, we will transfer all of our avocado from the bowl by spreading it onto our toast</li>
    </ol>
    <em>And enjoy</em>
